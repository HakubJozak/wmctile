About
-----

Wmctile was created because of the regular set of Desktop Environments lacking crucial features such as:

1. Switching windows based on application names.
2. Snapping windows to various sizes anywhere on the screen.
3. Resizing windows by a certain amount.
4. Tiling windows to fill the screen.

Wmctile enables you to do that and much more.

Is welcome. You'll need to `bundle install` to get the gems. Wmctile is TDD where possible, so please, test your code :) It's as simple as running `guard`.
